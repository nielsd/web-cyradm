    <para>
	This document guides you through the installation of all the software used by Web-cyradm. 
	The goal is a fully functional high-performance mailsystem with user-administration with Web-cyradm, 
	a webinterface. Data like virtualusers, aliases etc. are stored in a mysql database.

<!-- Section1: intro -->

 <sect1 id="intro">
   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
   The cyrus part is only valid for Cyrus-IMAP 2.2.x (also 2.1.x) and Cyrus-SASL 2.1.x. If you plan to use Cyrus-IMAP 2.0.x
   then please consult the deprecated version 1.0.x of this HOWTO.</para>
 
  <para>
  I strongly recommend that you upgrade to Cyrus Version 2.2.x. If you do so, you will have a better ability to get
  valuable support from the user community</para>

	<title>Contributors and Contacts</title>
	<para>First I would thank all those people who sent questions and suggestions that made the
	further development of this document possible. It shows me that sharing knowledge is the right way.
	I would encourage you to send me more suggestion, just write me an email <email>luc at delouw.ch</email>

   <sect2>
	<title>Why I wrote this document</title>

	<para>There are different approaches on how to set up different mailsystems. Most documents that are available are
	related to Sendmail, procmail, WU-IMAPd and friends. These packages are very good but are unfortunately very
	inflexible in their user administration.
	</para>

	<para>For a long time I was testing alternative MTA's like qmail, postfix and exim, in conjunction with IMAP/POP-servers like 
	Cyrus, vpopmail, Courier IMAP and others.</para>
	
	<para>At the end of the day, from my point of view the couple Postfix/Cyrus seems to be the
	most flexible and best performing solution.</para>
	
	<para>All these combinations of software had one thing in common: there was very little documentation available
	describing how these packages work together with each other.
	To install the software, lot of effort was spent to get all information needed to get all the 
	software running.</para>

  <sect2 id="postfix">
   <title>The Postfix MTA</title>
	<blockquote><attribution>www.postfix.org</attribution>
	<para>
        Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time
        being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside has a
        sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.</para></blockquote>
	<para>
		<figure>
	        <title>Postfix - the big picture</title>
      			<graphic FileRef="big-picture.png"></graphic>
     		</figure>
   	</para>

	<para>Doesn't it look impressive? - It looks much more complicated than it is. Postfix is indeed nice
	      to configure and handle.</para>

	<para>Unlike sendmail, postfix is not one monolithic program, it is a compilation of small programs, each of
	      which has a specialized function. 
	      At this point I don't what to go into details about what each program does what.
	      If you are interested how Postfix works, please see the documentation at 
	      <ulink url="http://www.postfix.org/docs.html">http://www.postfix.org/docs.html</ulink>
	</para>	

	<para>In this document you will find the information needed to get the system running in conjunction with the other components of a full e-mail setup.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cyrus">
   <title>Cyrus IMAP</title>
	<para>Cyrus IMAP is developed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University.</para>

	<para>Unlike the WU-IMAPd package, Cyrus uses its own method to store the user's mail. 
	Each message is stored in its own file. 
	The benefit of using separate files is improved reliability since only one message is lost if there is a filesystem error.
	Metadata such as the status of a message (seen, etc) is stored in a database.
	Additionally, the messages are indexed to improve Cyrus performance, specially with lots of users and/or lots of big emails.
	There is nothing else as fast as the Cyrus IMAP-server.</para>

	<para>
	Another very important feature is that you don't need a local Un*x user for each account. All users are 
	authenticated by the IMAP-Server. This makes it a great solution when you have a really huge number of users.</para>

	<para>
	User administration is done by special IMAP-commands. This allows you to either use the commandline interface
	or use one of the available Web interfaces. This method is much more secure than a Webinterface to
	<filename> /etc/passwd</filename>.</para>

	<para>Starting from Cyrus 2.1, SASL-lib version 2 is used for authentication. 
	For the setup described in this HOWTO, a tree-layer authentication is implemented.
	Cyrus authenticates with saslauthdaemon which forwards the request
	to pam_mysql which finally looks up the user information in the MySQL-table.</para>

	<para>
	Since CMU changed the license policy for Cyrus, this software is going to be used by many more users.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sasl">
   <title>Cyrus SASL</title>
	<para>SASL means »Simple Authentication and Security Layer«. It is standardized by the IETF (Internet 
	Engineering Taskforce). SASL is used by network servers (in this case Cyrus-IMAP) to
	handle authentication requests from clients.</para>

	<para>Cyrus SASL is a extensive software, and sometimes not	easy to understand.
	Even I have just the minimum knowledge needed to write this HOWTO.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="openssl">
   <title>OpenSSL</title>
	<para>OpenSSL is a library needed by SASL for encryption of the data-stream. It is used by 
	almost all opensource software that need encryption.
	Most or all Un*x distributions come with a pre-installed OpenSSL.
	Be sure to also install the appropriate devel-package. If you like, you can 
	compile OpenSSL by yourself. This will be required if you need to fix a security hole.
	</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="mysql">
   <title>MySQL Database</title>
        <para>MySQL is a very fast, powerful and very easy to use database.</para>
	
	<para>Since Cyrus can authenticate its users with pam, you can use pam_mysql as a connector to the
	user database stored in MySQL. This allows you to create a nice Webinterface for your users for changing 
	passwords, defining and deleting aliases and more.</para>
	
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="pam-mysql">
  <title>pam_mysql</title>
	
	<para>pam means "Pluggable Authentication module" and was originally proposed by some people at Sun.
	In meantime a lot of modules have been developed. One of them is an interface to MySQL</para>

	<para>With pam_mysql you store the users password in a MySQL database. Further, Postfix is able to
	lookup aliases from a MySQL-table. At the end of the day, you have a base for all administrative tasks
	to be done by the postmaster.</para>
	
	<para>You will be able to delegate some tasks to powerusers. For example, tasks such as creating accounts, changing passwords and creating new aliases can be delegated to an administrator for a particular domain. 
	At the end of the day, you, as a sysadmin, will have the time to do some more productive tasks or write a HOWTO for the Linux Documentation Project.</para>

  <sect2 id="web-cyradm">
   <title>Web-cyradm Webinterface</title>

                </figure>
        </para>

        <para>Web-cyradm is the webinterface that allows you to perform the administrative tasks required to maintain the mail system.
	This screenshot shows the domain administration part of Web-cyradm.</para>
	
       <para>Web-cyradm is written in PHP, the most sophisticated html-preprocessor language.
        If you don't have a webserver with php installed, I would like to refer you to my

	Most of the software is included in your Linux distribution. I. e. SuSE is shipping Cyrus as 
	far as I know since 7.1.
	Since SuSE 8.1, cyrus-imap 2.1 and sasl2 is included, and works. It is still recommended to compile
	Cyrus by yourself. SuSE does not ship a MySQL enabled Postfix.

	Since version 0.5.2 web-cyradm uses PEAR as a database abstraction layer. This adds more flexibility. 
	MySQL and PostgreSQL are currently supported. Please note that a patch is required for PostgreSQL 
	because Postfix does not support PostgreSQL natively. I strongly suggest that you use MySQL.
        I know MySQL has some restrictions on transactions and stuff, but it is supported in the distributed Postfix code.

  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Crypted passwords</title>
	<para>Web-cyradm supports the storage of encrypted passwords. I strongly suggest the use of encryption.
	There are three methods supported at the moment: Unix-compatible (crypt), md5 and MySQL.
	The Unix-compatible encryption allows you to import encrypted passwords from an 
	existing <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>. This is the preferred option.
	</para>

	<para>
	Unfortunately, MySQL uses a proprietary encryption method which is only available
	when using MySQL. I'm currently thinking about dropping support for MySQL crypt, because it only
	works with MySQL and makes a migration to another database impossible. As soon as there is a method available
	to re-engineer the MySQL crypt on PHP there will be a solution (Help needed in programming, legal constraints?)
	</para>

	<para>Check the variable <varname>$CRYPT</varname> in the file <filename>config.inc.php</filename>. 
	Value »plain« means no encryption, »crypt« means Shadow compatible encryption, 
	mysql means MySQL encryption.</para>

	<caution><title>Choose encryption method carefully</title>
	<para>
	Since the supported encryption methods are all one-way encryptions, there will be NO WAY to migrate from
	one to another. Note also, that this is a global variable, it is used for all passwords,
	including the password of the admin users. I STRONGLY suggest the use of Unix Shadow compatible encryption,
	because it makes you independent of any software vendor.
	</para>
	</caution>

  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Usernames</title>
	<para>
	There are two username schemes supported which are defined in the variable »DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX«.
	The default is to have a defined prefix ($DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX=0), i.e. »test« for the domain »expample.com«.
	With this scheme, the first user gets the username test0001, the second test0002 and incrementing.
	</para>

	<para>The other one is to have usernames like »hans.mueller.example.com«. 
	If that case set $DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX=1</para>

	<para>At the moment you can not mix both schemas, evaluate carefully with scheme matches your needs best</para>

<title>Brief introdcution to viruses</title>

<para>I think I do not need to explain how dangerous Viruses are. Unfortunately in the most recent attacks from SCO.A (aka MyDoom) also more or less experienced users get tricked by viruses. Most of todays viruses and worms comes via the internet, most of them via E-Mail. Needless to say, that viruses should be catched by the SMTP system if possible.</para>

<caution><title>Not a substitute</title>
<para>A mailsystem that filters viruses is NEVER a substitute for a local installed anti-virus software. E-Mails are only one way how viruses can penetrate computers.</para>
</caution>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="brief-spam">
<title>Brief introduction to SPAM</title>

<para>
The other harmless but unwanted and disturbing E-Mails are SPAM e-mails. SPAM is originally a disgusting canned meat. It is a synonym for UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email) and UBE (Unsolicited Bulk Email).

<para>
Studies claim, that up to 60 percent of the worldwide e-mail traffic is SPAM. Before I installed the anti-SPAM filters on my SMTP servers, I received about 150 SPAMS's a day. One reason is this document. In ancient time, I noticed my real e-mail address unprotected. E-mail harvesters are scanning websites allover the world for addresses, and try to deliver its commercial, often illegal offers.

<sect2 id="strategy-viruses">
<title>Strategy against viruses</title>

<para>The strategy against viruses is pretty forward: Filtering viruses delivered via e-mail and having a localally installed anti-virus software.</para>

<para>Almost all vendors of anti-virus software have a up-to-date version for Linux and Unix Systems, because most SMTP servers are running on Unix. In this document I'll explain HOWTO implement <ulink url="http://www.clamav.net">clamav</ulink>, a very active open source anti virus project.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="strategy-spam">
<title>Strategy against SPAM</title>

<para>
Fighting against SPAM is much more difficult than viruses. Why? It is because every virus has a unique signature. SPAM can contain arbitrary content. Some of the SPAM is in english, other is korean, other is in "you-name-it-language".</para>

<para>The best method how to prevent SPAM is to handle your e-mail address as your best treasured secret. NEVER put your address in a web-form or put it on your website. I know, that is against the idea of the internet. Information must be free. You can keep publishing your e-mail address if you implement the configuration further below.

<para>In the beginning of SPAM, filtering for keywords like »viagra« was enough. Todays SPAM techniques are much more sophisticated. It is a war between users and spammers. The solution against sophisticated SPAM is even more sophisticated anti-spam software.Todays anti-spam software checks e-mail for more than just keywords. They are checking for specific mail-header data etc. Also a technique called <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_probability">bayesian</ulink> filters which can learn from particular input, distributed checksum networks etc.</para>

<question>
  <para>
Does web-cyradm only support users like »test0001« ? I'd like to have a more descriptive username
</para>
</question>

<answer>
	<para>
	web-cyradm does also support usernames like »user.name.example.com« if you configure it.
	Your need to change config.inc.php and change the value of DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX to 1. then you need to add
	»unixhierarchysep: yes« to your <filename>/etc/imapd.conf</filename>
	</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
	<para>
	Messages are bouncing. Postfix/pipe complains that "Mailbox does not exist". Whats wrong?
	</para>
</question>

<answer>
	<para>
	Check that the cyrus login on web-cyradm (config.inc.php) is correct.
	The username and password must exist in MySQL on table accountuser. 
	Web-cyradm will not complain if the cyrus login info is incorrect.
	</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>

     <para>
	web-cyradm complains about »Fatal error: Call to undefined function: bindtextdomain()
 	in /www/web-cyradm-0.5.3/index.php on line 46«, whats wrong?
     </para>
</question>

<answer>
	<para>
	Web-cyradm needs gettext enabled PHP. Please compile PHP with the configure-option --with-gettext.
	</para>
	<para>	
	gettext is needed for NLS (Native Language Support) which means
	contributors can easily translate web-cyradm to there language. Fill in your Language in the file
	<filename>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/web-cyradm/locale/templates/web-cyradm.pot</filename> and send me
	the file, then your language will be supported in the next CVS snapshot</para>

</answer>

<qandaentry><question>

	<para>
	I got a error from Web-cyradm like this »Fatal error: Call to undefined function: query() in
	/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/web-cyradm/auth.inc.php on line 17«
	</para>
</question>

<answer>
	<para>
	Web-cyradm depends on PEAR for database abstraction. PEAR is included in recent PHP versions. Often
	PEAR is a separate package, check out the package base of your distribution. I strongly suggest to update
	to the most recent version of PHP anyway, because a lot of bugs have been fixed.</para>

	<para>Another reason could be an authentication error with MySQL. Be sure the user »mail« has enough
	rights to access the database and tables.</para>

     <para>
      Why MySQL and not LDAP?
     </para>

</question>

<answer>
     <para>
      Good question. LDAP is role-based and it would be indeed a better solution for such applications. 
      Unfortunately LDAP is very hard to set up. You have to make proper schemes etc. MySQL is the 
      way strait ahead, it is very easy to handle and versatile. There is a PAM module available 
      for LDAP, feel free to use it.
     </para>

<qandaentry><question>
     <para>
      Why Postfix and not Qmail?
     </para>
</question>

<answer>
     <para>
      Lots of people like to see such a setup with Qmail. The reason why is, Mysql-support is a hack and not in the
      included in the main source-tree. This could end up in a bad situation. Think if a security-hole is found in qmail
      and the patch does not work with the corrected version. Postfix is supporting MySQL natively. 
      Another (personal) reason is that I find Postfix more sympatic (I don't know why)
     </para>

</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>

     <para>
      I got a Error: "Temporary lookup failure"
     </para>

</question>
<answer>

     <para>
      Postfix cannot look up the alias table. Must common failure is that MySQL is not running, 
      or there is a authentication Error. Check <filename>/var/log/mail</filename> and 
      <filename>/usr/local/mysql/var/&lt;hostname&gt;.err</filename> to track the error.
     </para>

</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>

     <para>
      For what platforms does this HOWTO work?
     </para>

</question>
<answer>

     <para>
      It is primarily for Linux. Until now I only tested it on Linux/IA32. Most probably it will also work on other 
      architectures.
      FreeBSD is reported working fine. AIX has problems with at least PHP. Please report if you got it running 
      on other platform, so I can update this section.
     </para>
